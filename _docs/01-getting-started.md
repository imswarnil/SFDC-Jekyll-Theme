Welcome to the theme documentation! This guide will walk you through the initial setup process.

### 1. Installation

You can install this theme in two ways:

1.  **Forking on GitHub (Recommended):** Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and rename it to `your-username.github.io`.
2.  **Manual Download:** Download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.

### 2. Dependencies

This theme uses the Jekyll bundler method. You'll need Ruby and Bundler installed. Once you have them, navigate to the theme's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
bundle install
