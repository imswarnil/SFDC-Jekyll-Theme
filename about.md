story: |
  My career began not in a server room, but behind a camera lens. As a filmmaker, I learned the art of crafting a compelling narrativeâ€”of understanding an audience, structuring a story, and focusing on the details that create an emotional impact. This foundation proved invaluable when I transitioned into the world of technology. I discovered that building a Salesforce solution is a lot like producing a film: it requires a clear vision, a talented team, and a deep understanding of the end user's needs.

  After earning my degree in Information Systems, I dove headfirst into the Salesforce ecosystem. I was captivated by its power to transform businesses. My first role as an Administrator taught me the fundamentals of the platform, while my time as a Developer at Appirio honed my technical skills in Apex and Visualforce. Today, as a Technical Consultant at FinancialForce, I get to combine all these passions: solving complex technical puzzles, designing elegant user experiences, and helping clients write their own success stories.
